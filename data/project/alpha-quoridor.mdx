We build an agent that masters Quoridor Board Game. Quoridor is not so famous game and there is not a lot of research about it. It has a state-space complexity similar to Chess with a higher game-tree complexity. We code this game like AlphaGo Zero from Deepmind, which learns to play the game by self-playing without human games data.
