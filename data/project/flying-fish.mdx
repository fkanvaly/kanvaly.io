Our project is part of an initiative jointly initiated by ENSTA Bretagne and EDF concerning the dam on Lake Guerl√©dan, which aims to check the state of the evacuation grids set up by EDF to evacuate water from the cooling circuits of nuclear power plants into the nearby river.

The drone we want to design and build will have to be able not only to fly but also to immerse itself to evolve in an aquatic environment, to access dangerous areas for divers. It will have to maintain its stability in currents that may exist in all watercourses or around a dam. An autonomous travel procedure is also envisaged.
