Our goal was to firstly build a multiple object tracker by different methods of detection and tracking. Then choose an application domain. We chose to work on surveillance and security. The user can segment the region of interest in a video scene and any new object motion, position, and time spend there. Then after a certain amount of time, we start identification (if it is a human or a car) in an asynchronous way and launch an alarm given the result of identification.
