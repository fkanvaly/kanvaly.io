Finding dense regions in a graph is an interesting problem in graph mining. We work on the implementation of the 2-approximation algorithm for the densest subgraph problem. In this report, we present our implementation of this algorithm in C++ and the data structure that’s allow us to have linear running time in the size of the input graph.
