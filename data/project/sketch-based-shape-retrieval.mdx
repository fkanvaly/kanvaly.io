I choose to work on the problem of sketch-based retrieval for this semester, where the goal is to find relevant 3D models in a large collection. The input is a rough 2D sketch, rather than a complete 3D model. This problem is challenging and will allow me to use very well-developed techniques from image analysis. My goal will be to read and implement a recent paper, [Sketch-Based Shape Retrieval](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/pdf/2012_siggraph_sbsr.pdf), and test it on any dataset, such as the one [described here](http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/vug/sharp/contest/2013/SBR/).
