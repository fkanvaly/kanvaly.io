Our task was on predicting links between pages in a subgraph of the French web graph. The web graph is a directed graph G(V, E) whose vertices correspond to the pages of the French web. A directed edge connects page U to page V if there exists a hyperlink on page â€‹ U pointing to page â€‹ V . From the original subgraph, edges have been deleted at randomâ€‹ . Given a set of candidate edges, our job was to predict which ones appeared in the original subgraph. Each node is associated with a text file extracted from the HTML of the corresponding webpage.
