In this work, we were trying to predict credit default risk. We were dealing with historical credit clients' information and were willing to predict whether or not a client will reimburse his credit. This is a standard supervised classification task. First of all, we analyze and clean the data. Then, extract the relevant pattern. Then train models and optimize the most promising. Finally, we use stacking to build a strong predictor.
